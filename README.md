Some kind of recipe maker(not the name)....Often you might have an almost empty fridge, to the point were you have random items in there but you’re too tired or not creative enough to come up with a meal. I want to create an app that takes the few items you have in your fridge and comes up with a quick and simple recipe so that your food and time doesn’t go to waste. I will use a food/ recipe API.
